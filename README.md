# Word Counter Journal

This project is a simple yet effective tool for those who want to improve their writing habits and consistency. It aims to encourage users to write at least 200 words daily. Built using Python and the tkinter library, the application features a user-friendly interface with a word count functionality and an ability to save the day's entry into a log file.

## Features

- **Word Counter:** Provides an instant word count of the text you have written, enabling you to track your daily word count goal.

- **Daily Entries:** Allows you to save your entries if they are more than 200 words. Each entry is tagged with the current date for easy tracking and future reference.

- **Prevents Multiple Entries:** Ensures you can only make one entry per day by checking if an entry for the current date already exists.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Comes with an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI for a smooth user experience.

## Installation and Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
